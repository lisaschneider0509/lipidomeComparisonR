```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data_path <- "/home/lisa/FH/Masterarbeit/TestData/lipidome_comparison_test_data.csv"
```

## Data import


```{r data}
input_data <- read.csv(data_path)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
